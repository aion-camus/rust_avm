/**
 * An implementation of the storage fees which bills costs directly to the IInstrumentation instance for the corresponding call frame.
 * 
 * TODO:  Determine if we want to continue using the IInstrumentation of the current call frame or the thread local IInstrumentation from the top.
 * How we interpret this has serious implications into how storage billing is done in reentrant DApps.
 * 
 * Implications of using to corresponding call frame (current approach):
 * -each operation corresponds directly to when data becomes visible or committed within the context of the corresponding call
 * -this "visibility" may not have been triggered by the corresponding call, but a sub-call
 *  -this is due to the rule that a sub-calls faulted graph must always be a subset of the caller's faulted graph
 * -this means that a sub-call can actually cause its caller to run out of energy
 *  -forcing the caller to fault in the object bills their IInstrumentation, not one currently running
